Towards clarifying our signals processing capabilities for various neural- and bio-sensing modalities (including for example de-noising, artifact removal, and feature identification); towards providing a mature foundation for transfer- and co-learning of predictors that provide value to the medical community; towards enabling biofeedback gaming that enhances users' self-awareness and self-regulatory skills regarding cognitive and emotional states (e.g. akin to making it easier to learn mindfulness meditation).
